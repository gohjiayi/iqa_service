#  The first thing a build process does is send the entire context (recursively) to the daemon. In most cases, itâ€™s best to start with an empty directory as context and keep your Dockerfile in that directory. Add only the files needed for building the Dockerfile.
# To use a file in the build context, the Dockerfile refers to the file specified in an instruction, for example, a COPY instruction.

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r /requirements.txt
